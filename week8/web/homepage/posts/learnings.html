        <h1>What this assignment is teaching me</h1>
        <p>
            Here is a short and quick list of things I learnt while doing this assignment:
        <ul>
            <li>Re-using the same html code is possible by dynamically loading the page with JQuery. JQuery, as its name
                suggests, allows you to query the DOM, and then manipulate it. In our case, we search for the
                placeholder that we want to replace with the duplicate HTML, then load the corresponding static HTML
                file</li>
            <li>CORS: Cross origin resource sharing: it is a policy in web browsers that disables the ability of scripts
                to fetch local files on the client's computer. Letting websites access your local files would be
                dangerous. Instead, only accessing files from the same domain is enabled by default. To bypass this, you
                can serve the files locally, then access that server, for example with "python -m SimpleHTTPServer".
            </li>
            
        </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

<div id="navbar-bottom"></div>
